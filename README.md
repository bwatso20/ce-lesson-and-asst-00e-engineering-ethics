**1.3.1**
When doing a search on ethics Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy I found something called virtue ethics and after reading some of it I found a generalized definition of ethics that I enjoyed. The quote is as follows, "Suppose it is obvious that someone in need should be helped. A utilitarian will point to the fact that the consequences of doing so will maximize well-being, a deontologist to the fact that, in doing so the agent will be acting in accordance with a moral rule such as 'Do unto others as you would be done by' and a virtue ethicist to the fact that helping the person would be charitable or benevolent." This is generalized because it does ot just reflect one person's view of ethics, it shows they all are different and unique. The trend they all share is the idea of morals and doing the right thing, or what some may say is the just thing. There is no right way to be ethical and many philosophers have different ideas of how to do so. These are also three very striking types of ethics that all take different approaches. 

**1.3.2**
Aristotle isn't laying the burden on us but instead he is telling us to lay the burden upon ourselves because we must be the ones that practice ethics because ethics is for us the people. Aristotle is also expressing his confidence that there is no one way to be ethical. It is the people's responsibility to be ethical in whichever way works for them and having the option to not just act ethically in a specific way people have less of an excuse to not be ethical.

**2.3.1**
If everyone in society was ethical all the time there would be a loss in the balance between everyone. In a society where everyone is ethical there wouldt be rules for ethics and so if people fell into unethical ways they would be stuck. The person acting unethical would just act and there would be no guidelines. So society would lose the balance that exists, people use this balance to grow and relate to. Without it people would be more lost in finding their way because this guide they had to grow according to would be gone.

**2.3.2**
The group cannot exist without the individuals, they make up the group and give it defining factors. The group is beneficial because it gives multiple opinions that can be shared and balanced. By this I mean that all the parts of the group contribute to a mass collection of opinions and they must each be weighed to see the positive and negative aspects. Once they have all come together they can balance the positives from the negatives and make ethical decisions.

**3.3.1**
The article has much to say about the outcome of research after natural disasters but the biggest point it brings up is whether the information collected is worth the harm caused to the people. This ethical debate is countered on the potential good that comes with this research. One big problem is the conflict between countries and the resources they have. An inequality can grow by the lack of resources because a country canâ€™t always take care of itself. This causes people from other countries needing to come and disrupt the people from their already hard recovery. This makes the ethics complicated because someone could justify sending people for research and not sending people both ethically sound.

**3.3.2**
First ethical issue of this pandemic is the stay at home order because for some it makes perfect sense to try and prevent spread as much as possible by staying home. On the other hand many people live their life on the go and this is a big halt for them, some of those people can't do the jobs in which they think are ethical. Second, wearing of the masks in public. This is also just to help slow the spread from person to person but for some this is a violation of their rights and they feel as if it should not apply to them. Finally, the overflow of body's primarily in New York. In New York they had to start making mass grave sights for all of the bodies of individuals killed by covid-19 because of the filling up of morgues. This is very touchy ethically and is sad because if more thought as time went into thinking of a more ethical solution they may have been able to do something better. 

**4.3.1**
The code of ethics provided me with a deeper understanding of the importance of computer engineering that I didn't have before. The more I read the more I saw that computer engineering isn't a secluded activity it is one where you need to work together and understand your personal flaws. In section 2.6 perform work only in areas of competence, this is something new for me because I was always under the impression that if you didn't know something you had to try and preserve it because you are supposed to know all things in the field. I learned that there are too many things in the field to learn and when you are in a position in which you are stuck the best thing to do is let someone know. 

**4.3.2**
Microsoft's Open source code of conduct addresses the users of the code AKA us, and tells the ethical guideline to using and accessing the code provided. It is also an explanation of how to treat each other over microsoft's open source codes. The most important element in the open source code of conduct is the way people treat each other and that they are a community. THey want the people who use this software to be welcomed and not discriminated against or attacked. In our class we used microsoft makecode which has many open source codes that we used. 

**4.3.3**
The main ethical aspect that was explained in the article Data Ethics is information. Information can be used and molded=, this raises an important ethical issue of whether the data should be collected because this information is only as safe as the software and hardware put in place to protect it. 

**4.3.4**
This technical conference needs its own code of conduct because even though it is happening virtually it is still a place where people want to hear their opinions and ask questions. They intend to make it a safe environment so that everyone involved is protected and to keep the conference professional and respectful. 

**4.3.5**
The biggest concern that google states in their principles of artificial intelligence is that it will have united goals or results. THey also express a concern of it causing harm, gathering information without costrait and to break laws. They are responsible for knowing the risk and understanding it, also they are responsible for the safe storage of it.

**4.3.6**
Sice hacking is characterized usually as illegal when placed with ethics it is hard to see a connection. Hacking is breaking into a code that should be accessible from the outside and changing it. This is very unethical because people make their code for themselves so that they can use it and perhaps store data in it. When it is hacked people's information or software can be taken or manipulated and that is not ok. But when used together this can lead to fixing problems that existed in code before. An example is facial recognition didn't work as well on faces of color so someone could hack in and fix it so that it works evenly. This is an ethically ok form of hacking.


**5.3.1**
When working on a project as a group there is always risk associated with each party of the group. A member could easily defect and with him take valuable information or delete something important to the project. A way to help steer away from defection is to incentivise the members of a group with a completion reward, something that when all is said and done they are rewarded for finishing it and staying true till the end. This would prevent the urge to take and run while the code is still in progress.

**5.3.2.i**
The technical iovation at the heart of my new company is to create solar panels with built in power converters. So when the light comes in it is instantly converted into power and stored.

**5.3.2.iia**
Some adverse effects of this iovatio would be first, one would be how to store all the power and what would happen when the storage is full and the sun keeps shining. This could be solved by having a technician go to each sight and manually transfer the energy to a new storage device for transportation and distribution. This leads to the second adverse effect which is costs being high, for each location to need a technician would be quite expensive and then that leads to the third problem which is misuse. The technicians would be with the power very often and could easily change numbers and be selfish with the power. This could be potentially solved with a smart tracking software that tracks the power coming in and out of the mobile storage sights and the panels themselves to all be linked to a centralized database.

**5.3.2.iib**
At the launch of this innovation it will be the first of its kind and get a lot of recognition but because of the price point it will not be open to everyone and only a select kind of individual will be interested. Which is wrong because the sun would be saving people money that already has so much, not the people who could be using the extra pennies saved to help the family. Once it has been absorbed into most everyday life, the cost could have gone down so the availability of the product would grow to the places where it is really helpful and making a difference and a negative associated with it is the life o them may not be very long and they need to replace which could end up causing more waste in the earth that it is helping take out of the air. 

**5.3.3**
The workplace environment that I will create will be welcoming and inviting to all, and I want people like Apple to be trained on their rights before even starting to work. ALso with a goal that is oriented to helping the planet the people that join will need to have the same goal and know that we will make a difference. Taking care of employees is of growing importance and making sure they have good benefits and that their family cca have the benefits alswell to express we are all family. This will promote a focused work environment that's goal oriented in the same direction.

**5.3.4**
My code of ethics would be as follows
1. Treat each other and their ideas with respect and compassion.
2. stay zero waste in the areas we can, reuse everything else we can.
3. keep all private information safe and secure.
4. while conducting business, keep integrity.
5. Keep interests and goals aligned with the customers.
6. keep all assets protected.

**5.3.5i**
I removed the 3rd line, changed the 5th to "keep all goals aligned with shareholders" and removed the 6th. My code has been weakened because with this new company goals we would not be acting in an ethical way and the company's goals could be easily changed by someone other than the company.
**5.3.5ii**
There should have existed a code that is "the goals on this company will always stay ethical and in sync with the opinion of the company as a whole, no single member has the power to change."
